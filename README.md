# graphixlab

Welcome to graphixlab—a digital forge where my ideas in computer graphics take shape. Here, pixels, shaders, and algorithms come together in a symphony of color and geometry, revealing the boundless possibilities of visual computing. This space is my creative sanctuary, inspired heavily by Prof. Dr. Meyer’s **Computer Graphics** and **GPU Image Synthesis** course at the University of Applied Sciences Coburg, and fueled by a relentless curiosity for the art and science of rendering.

In GraphixLab, you’ll find concepts brought to life in code, snapshots of my experiments, and sparks of inspiration crafted in both human (my notes) and machine language (my code snippets). 

Dive in, explore, and join me on this journey to uncover the magic behind the **computer graphics**.
